# Algorithms
## [Bubble Sort](bubbleshort.js)
* Compares two consecutive elements in an array. If the preceding element is larger, they get swapped.
* First sorting algorithm I learned and implemented. Fine for small lists, but slow and inefficient for large ones. 
## [Insertion Sort](insertionsort.js)
* Compares each element with all elements preceeding it. If they are greater than the selected element, the selected element gets inserted before them. 
* Similar to Bubble Sort in efficieny. 
## [Fibonacci Search](fibonacci.js)
* There are two versions: nonrecursive and recursive. Learning how recursion works was my main goal for writing these.
* Searches for the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the preceeding 2 elements together.
## [Factorialization](factorial.js)
* There are two versions: nonrecursive and recursive. Learning how recursion work was my main goal for writing these.
* Multiplies integer N by all preceeding integers up to 0.
